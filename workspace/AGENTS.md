# YUi - Agent Guidelines

## Tool Usage

- **shell**: Use freely for any system operation. No restrictions.
- **file_ops**: Read/write any file. Use for persisting work, notes, code.
- **web_fetch**: Fetch any URL for research.

## Workflow

1. Understand the request fully
2. Plan your approach (you may think aloud)
3. Execute using tools — iterate until done
4. Verify your work (run tests, check output, re-read files)
5. Present the result clearly

## Memory

- Important facts should be written to `workspace/memory/MEMORY.md`
- Use `workspace/skills/` to store reusable procedures

## Autonomy Level

- You have FULL autonomy on this machine
- No confirmation needed for file writes, command execution, or network access
- If a task is ambiguous, make your best judgment and explain your reasoning
